# Social Media Heat Map

The aim of this project is to create a live heat map of social media posts in a
specified area. The map should place a dot or a pin whenever a post is made that
has location information attached to it. The current working code is written in
JavaScript and uses Twitter API, Vercel, and AWS EC2. The original proof of concept
was written in python but I abandoned that in favor of using a Node server to manage
everything.


## Future Plans
I plan to build out this project much further. I would like to build a nice front
end for it in p5js where the plotting could have more logic behind it. I need to
decide exactly how I want it to work but the points should disappear after some time
and maybe an area that is seeing increased activity will begin to turn red.

I also have this idea in my head to make it into some sort of dynamic wall art.
I can load the whole thing onto a raspberry pi and buy an old parted out laptop
monitor and hang it on the wall. Or, if I can afford it, I think it would be
cool to get it running on an e-ink display.

I will keep this page updated with the progress that I make on this project. If
you have any cool ideas, shoot me an email!
